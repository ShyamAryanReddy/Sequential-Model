        <h3>Mild Non-proliferative Retinopathy</h3>
        <p>The first stage is also called background retinopathy.
            It means that there are tiny bulges in the tiny blood vessels in your retinas.
            The bulges are called microaneurysms.
            They may cause the vessels to leak small amounts of blood into your retinas.</p>
        <p>At this early stage, you probably don’t have vision problems, so you may not need treatment.
            Talk to your doctor about ways to keep your condition from getting worse.
            You'll need to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels under control.
            You should plan to have another screening test in 12 months.</p>
        <p>If the doctor diagnoses you with this condition in both eyes, you have a 25% chance of progressing to the third stage in the next 3 years.</p>
    {% elif diagnosis == 1 %}
        <h3>Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
        <p>The second stage is also called pre-proliferative retinopathy.
            At this stage, the blood vessels in your retinas swell.
            They may not carry blood as well as they used to.
            These things can cause physical changes to the retina.</p>
        <p>These changes can lead to diabetic macular edema (DME).
            This happens when blood and other fluids build up in a part of your retina called the macula.
            The macula is key for straight-ahead vision, like when you read or drive.
            When it swells, it can cause problems with this important part of your vision.</p>
        <p>Half the people with diabetic retinopathy will get DME.
            It can happen at any stage, but it’s more likely to happen as the condition advances.</p>
        <p>Reaching this stage means a greater chance that the disease will affect your vision.
            Your doctor may recommend eye tests every 3 to 6 months.</p>
    {% elif diagnosis == 2 %}
        <h3>Non-Proliferate Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
        <p>When you have nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken.
            Tiny bulges protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina.
            Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well.</p>
        <p>NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked.</p>
        <p>Sometimes retinal blood vessel damage leads to a buildup of fluid (edema) in the center portion (macula) of the retina.
            If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss.</p>
    {% elif diagnosis == 3 %}
        <h3>Proliferate Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
        <p>In this advanced stage, new blood vessels grow in your retinas and into the gel-like fluid that fills your eyes.
            This growth is called neovascularization.
            These vessels are thin and weak.
            They often bleed. The bleeding can cause scar tissue.</p>
        <p>As the scar tissue gets smaller, it can pull the retina away from the back of your eye.
            This is called retinal detachment.
            It can lead to permanent loss of both straight-ahead and side vision.</p>
    {% else %}
        <h3>Severe Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
        <p>This is also called proliferative retinopathy.
            In this stage, your blood vessels become even more blocked.
            This means even less blood goes to the retinas.
            Because of this, scar tissue forms.
            The lack of blood triggers a signal to your retinas to create new blood vessels.</p>
        <p>If the blood vessels close off completely, it's called macular ischemia.
            This can lead to blurry vision with dark spots some people describe as “floaters.”</p>
        <p>If you reach this stage, there’s a very high chance that you’ll lose your vision.
            Treatment may be able to stop further vision loss.
            But if you’ve already lost some of your vision, it’s unlikely to come back.</p>
